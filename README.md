# 2024 Code Jam

Tree species identification is an essential part of sustainable forest management. New remote sensing technologies allow us to measure forests in greater detail than ever before but identifying tree species remains challenging. Creating better analytical tools to accomplish this goal will require creativity, innovation, and expertise from a wide range of skill areas.
The 2024 Code Jam will challenge teams to develop novel methods to efficiently and accurately identify tree species from high resolution LiDAR point clouds.
The Code Jam is open to programmers of all skill levels.
